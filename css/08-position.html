        The 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division of the British Territorial Army was formed in September 1939 during the Second World War. Initially raised in Staffordshire, the division began as a second-line duplicate of the 55th (West Lancashire) Motor Division. It was tasked with anti-invasion and guard duties until late June 1944, when it was assigned to the Second Army and transferred to France to take part in the Battle of Normandy. On 8 July, the division helped capture Caen during Operation Charnwood; a week later, it assaulted the town of Noyers in Operation Pomegranate. In late July, when the German frontline was crumbling, the division captured a bridgehead over the River Orne and fended off counter-attacks to maintain its hold. Its final combat was a protracted battle to capture the town of Thury-Harcourt. Historians have praised the effort of the division in these battles, during which it suffered several thousand casualties.
